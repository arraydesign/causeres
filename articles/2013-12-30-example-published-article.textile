TEXTILE is a lightweight markup language originally developed by Dean Allen and billed as a “humane web text generator”. Textile converts its marked-up text input to valid, well-formed XHTML and also inserts character entity references for apostrophes, opening and closing single and double quotation marks, ellipses and em dashes.
