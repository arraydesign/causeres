## Published vs Draft Articles
* To separate published & draft articles a specific naming convention will be used for the filenames:
	- The filename of draft articles should be «draft-article-name.md»;
	- The filename of published articles should be «~published-article-name.md»;
* In other words published posts have the ‘~’ character at the beginning of their filenames;
* Regardless whether the article is a draft or is published the filename must be:
	- lowercase
	- alphanumeric characters only (A – Z, a – z, 0 – 9)
	- dashes instead of spaces

## Examples
* Two examples articles have been provided:
	- «example-article-1.md»
	- «~example-article-2.md»
